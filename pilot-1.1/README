Thank you for downloading Pilot.

Pilot presents a friendly face to the Message Passing Interface (MPI) that
allows a simpler programming model and provides many safety features that are
not available in MPI.

The Pilot website is located at:

First Steps
===========

    If you are new to Pilot, here's how we recommend you start:

    1. Read the LICENSE file and make sure you understand and accept it.

    2. You will want to read the INSTALL file for information about getting the
       library compiled and installed.

    3. You should then go through the tutorial at
       http://carmel.cis.uoguelph.ca/pilot/docs/tutorial/ or tutorial.txt in the
       "docs" directory.

    4. There are a set of man pages in the "docs" directory. Installation of
       these pages is described in the INSTALL file. You can use these pages as
       reference material as you start developing real code. The page you will
       probably be most interested in is called "pilot.h".
