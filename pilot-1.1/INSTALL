INSTALL instructions for Pilot
==============================
:date: 22 September 2009
:version: Version 1.1

Here's what you need to get Pilot compiled and installed:

    * The Pilot source distribution of your choice
    * Your favourite MPI implementation
    * If you would like to run the unit tests, you will need CUnit (version 2.1 or higher)
    * To generate and install the documentation, you will need Python (2.4 or higher) with Docutils, and Doxygen (1.5.6 or higher)


Building Pilot
==============

Configure the Makefile
----------------------

    Change the variable PREFIX to point to the directory that you wish pilot to
    be installed in. The pilot header files will be installed in
    $(PREFIX)/include and the library will be installed in $(PREFIX)/lib. Note
    that if these directories do not already exist, an attempt is made to create
    them.

    If your mpi compiler is not installed in a standard place, you will also
    have to change the variable CC to point to the proper compiler.

    Note that if you install Pilot to a non-standard directory, then you will
    have to make sure that the install directory is in your include and library
    path. You can use the mpicc -I and -L options to set those paths.

Compile
-------

    Once the Makefile has been configured, you can run::

        $ make
        $ make install

    For information on how to build and run the unit tests, see the README in
    the "tests" directory.


Installing the Manual Pages
===========================

    Pilot comes with a set of man pages to serve as reference material. These
    man pages are in the "docs" directory. If you would like to install these
    pages for system wide access, you can set the DOC_PREFIX variable in the
    main Makefile and then run::

        $ make install-man

    If you would like to view these man pages without installing them, you can
    change your MANPATH to include the "docs" directory. Alternatively, you can
    run man in the current directory and point it to the docs like so::

        $ man -M docs/man <page>

    Where <page> is the man page you want to view.
